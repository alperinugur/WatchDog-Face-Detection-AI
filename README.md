# WatchDog-Face-Detection-AI
This small software uses the webcam on your PC, and looks to identify faces.  When a face is identified in a frame, the frame will be added to the Video file that the program creates.  If selected, the WatchDog also sends e-mail of the captured faces.   There are a lot of variables, which you can change and play under #GLOBAL PARAMETERS
